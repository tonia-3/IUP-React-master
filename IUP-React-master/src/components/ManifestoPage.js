              1. Political views; prefer a lean, accountable, efficient and
              effective government whose role is to create a conducive
              environment for private sector to thrive by providing most
              services in a free market except in provision of services in
              Article 43 of the Kenyan constitution:(health, housing, food
              security, clean and safe water, social security and education),
              more regulation and services to be provided to all citizens
              through Public Private sector co-business integration in line with
              the Public Private Partnership Act of 2021.

              2. Land including renewable and non-renewable resources as a
              factor of production: efficiency in the economy is promoted since
              owners of resources will be given incentives to maximize land
              value except for large tracks of land that pose a threat to the
              country’s security due to terror activities where there will be
              confiscation of the idle arable land through development of a
              national land policy through legislations.

              3. Labour as a factor of production: labour refers to the effort
              that individuals exert when they produce a good or service, there
              will be freedom in labor meaning that no one can tell you what to
              do in order to earn money, and no one can tell you how to spend
              it. The value of labor is determined by the individual’s skills,
              training, education, and productivity. The education system will
              be revamped to include critical thinking in an effort to ensure
              Kenyans think start-up, innovation, and creativity.

              4. Capital as a factor of production, refers to the money that is
              used to purchase items that are used to produce goods and
              services, for this to work there is a need for incentives in
              economics, is the financial motivation for people to take certain
              actions. It allows businesses to become more creative and
              inventive, as everyone competes to have products or services that
              are better than their competitors to this end IUP administration
              will shun domestic borrowing.

              5. Entrepreneurship as a factor of production is a combination of
              the other three factors to produce a good or service for
              consumers. Entrepreneurship requires innovative ideas in planning
              and organizing production of goods and services to create supply
              and demand hence determining the prices of goods and services. If
              the good or service you are selling is in high demand, it is worth
              more. At the heart of entrepreneurship is competition that drives
              businesses to work at maximum efficiency and offer their products
              at the best prices with high quality to avoid getting beaten out
              by competitors that have better prices, efficiency, and quality.
              To this end IUP administration will legalize industrial hemp, a
              versatile raw material used in over 9 sectors to produce over
              25,000 that is short cycle and environmentally friendly.

              6. Abolition of distinction between urban and rural: through the
              combination of agriculture and manufacturing in the same area, in
              an effort to create markets for farmer's produce so as to avoid
              losses caused by a lack of markets for farmer’s produce while
              reducing rural to urban migration.
