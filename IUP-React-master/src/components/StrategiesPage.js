        Implementing Strategies for Pillars of Economic Reforms, Single-issue
        Ideology
      </h1>

      <p>
        The goal of IUP is to{" "}
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>GET THE COUNTRY MOVING</span>. This
        is in the backdrop of the 2021 Economic survey where it was noted that
        3.1 million Kenyans are formally employed while 15.3 million work in the
        informal sector, which is less structured, making it difficult to widen
        the tax base. The tragedy is that the 3 million end up facing the brunt
        of over taxation, hence the need to have more Kenyans onboarded into the
        formal sector for easier tax collection in the quest to achieve economic
        reforms, in IUP’s single-issue ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the aforementioned to be achieved, the strategies will be
        implemented, which will be a learning process for all party levels to
        benefit from:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Communicate the vision, mission, goal, and ideology to all party
          members who have not been involved in vision, mission, goal, and
          ideology formulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtain commitment from party members through disclosure and
          discussions in a consultative process such as meetings and team
          briefings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Framing the vision, mission, goal, ideology, policies, and procedures
          into action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting operational targets and objectives that are in line with the
          party vision, mission, goal, and ideology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assigning responsibility and commensurate authority to individuals and
          teams for the achievement of the vision, mission, goal, and ideology.
        </li>
        <li>Allocation of resources and agreeing budgets.</li>
        <li>
          Providing party leadership and members with the required training.
        </li>
        <li>
          Constantly monitoring the success or failure of the strategies and
          making required revisions.
        </li>
